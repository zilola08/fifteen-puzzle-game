# The **15-puzzle** game

[You can read about this game here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)

Instructions:

You are given shuffled set of tiles. You are required to rearrange the tiles in ascending order starting from the left top corner. So the winning arrangement would be such that the last slot (the right bottom slot) is empty and all other slots are filled with number tiles in ascenfing order.

You can move the tiles by clicking/tapping on them or using the arrow keys on the computer keyboard.

When the game is won, you will see the signal on your screen and will be prompted to enter player name. If your score is enough to make the top 10 high scores, you can see your score in the scoreboard. The less moves you make to win, the higher in the scoreboard your score will be.

In this game, the following features are implemented:

- Different gameboard sizes are available. The bigger the size, the more tiles you have to rearrange, hence higher is the difficulty of the game;

- Top 10 high scores for each gameboard size are saved, so you can keep the top-players list for each board size;

- Sound of a clicked tile can be turned on/off;

- You can start a new game at any point, and the timer and the move counter will reset instantly;

- Design is responsive: the bigger the screen, the bigger is the game layout;
